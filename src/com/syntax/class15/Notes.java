/*String are imutable that means once we store a string in a variable we can not change its value if 
 * we are changing the value a new object reference is reassiogned to that variable 
 * 
 * Stringbuilder is mutable which means we can change the value of the variable and no new memory cells are created 
 * 
 * use string when have a lot of repetition in the data and we care about memory consumption we should use string class
 * 
 * use stringbuilder when there are alot of changeds to data and we care more about speed of the program we should use stringbuilder 
 * class  difference between stringbuilder and stringbufer is that strinng builder is not threat safe hance more fast and 
 * stringbuffer is threat safe but slow 
 * 
 * Thread safety is a computer programming concept applicable to multi-threaded code. Thread-safe code only 
 * manipulates shared data structures in a manner that ensures that all threads 
 * behave properly and fulfill their design specifications without unintended interaction
