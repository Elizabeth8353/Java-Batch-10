	 * What is a bug= its a error or fault you find during testing that causes program/ application to produce an incorrect or
	 * an unexpected result or behave in an unexpected or unintended way.
	 * where do we find bugs= we can find it anywhere in testing phase or after application has been launched 
	 * 
	 * A bug can come in many forms= Even if the requirement is working as expected but the icon does not look like what the 
	 * client wanted it to look like
	 * A bug can be a function that dosn't do something that specification dosn't mention but it should
	 * Another button could be that the login button is in between the user and pass field

	 * Bug Cycle
	 * 1.reproduce the bug- safe to reproduce at least 5 time to make sure its a bug (intermittent bug- bugs that don't occure all the time)
	 * if you come across an intermittent bug note it down in case it happens in the future to make the team aware
	 * 2.Report the bug= 
	 * -One way is to create a ticket on a project management tool such as jira
	 * -some companies require you to send an email to the team about the bug defect before actually creating the bug because once 
	 * a bug ticket is created and reported the costumer might see it and loose confidence on development team
